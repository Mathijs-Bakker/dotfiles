# .dotfiles

## NeoVim, Tmux and Zsh configurations. 

My setup, for DotNet Core and Unity3D development on MacOS (or other *nix). 

Different projects have different requirements. So next to C#, I do occasionally Lua, Python, JavaScript and other languages. Whatever suits best.

### Nvim
I have sourced my plugin configurations for easy toggling (read: commenting out) in ``nvim/rc/plugins.vim``.

### iTerm2
This folder contains a user profile. To import manually into iTerm2.
iTerm doesn't have a config folder which could be symlinked to .dotfiles.
